# Smart Government

## Definition of Smart Government

Smart Government
* use technology to facilitate and support better planning and decision making 
* improve democratic processes and transforming the ways that public services are delivered
* include __e-Government__, the efficiency agenda and mobile working

Smart Governance
* the future of the public services
* greater efficiency (community leadership, mobile working and continuous improvement through innovation)

## Current status
* Public Sector Information portal over 4180 unique datasets, 1390 APIs
* 2018/19 gov I&T spending HK$10Billion
* 2021/2022 12Billion

## Current approach of HK Government
The government is stopping up efforts in I&T development in:

1. increasing resources for R&D
1. pooling together technology talent
1. providing investment funding
1. providing technological research infrastructure
1. reviewing existing legislation and regulations
1. opening up government data
1. government leading changes to procurement arrangements
1. strengthening science education

## Open Data
> European Data Portal "Open data is data which everyone can access, use and share. Governments, businesses and individuals can use open data to bring about social, economic and environment benefits. It is usable when made available in common, machine-readable format."

> Global open data index "Open data is the data and content that can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose"

How to assess open data?

Following measures:
* Completeness: is the data complete, does it include all relevant aspects?
* Accessibility: is the data machine accessible?
* Up to date: is the dataset timely?
* Description: is the data described fully?

## Smart city infrastructure

* Build a new big data analytics platform by 2020 which will enable real-time data transmission and sharing among government departments
* Adopt public cloud services with enhanced security features for government departments to deliver efficient e-services.
* Revamp the government cloud infrastructure platform to enable digital government services delivery through collaboration and partnership among government departments, IT service providers, and other third-party entities.

## Adoption of Technology

* Support adoption of technology by government departments to improve public services through dedicated funding
* Explore the development of smart city facilities, such as smart lampposts , smart rubbish and recyclables collection bins where appropriate

Example:
* Adopt Building Information Modelling (BIM)
* Major government capital works projects
* Develop Common Spatial Data Infrastructure (CSDI)
* Starting from 2018 to 2023
* To facilitate sharing of geo-spatial data across government departments and government-to-business (G2B) applications, e.g. 3D digital map.

## Adoption of Technology
1. Continue to promote the Smart Government Innovation lab to invite technology solutions and product suggestions from IT sector for enhancing public services and addressing city challenges
1. Launch City I&T Grand Challenge
1. promote E&M InnoPortal
1. Continue to promote adoption of technology by government
1. Implement e-licensing 
1. Advanced tech for water seepage in buildings
1. Implement smart sewerage monitoring system
1. Develop automated system for concrete cube testing
1. Apply robotics for underground drainage system maintenance
1. Apply robotics to facilitate in-line inspection of water mains
1. Adopt smart robotic underwater vehicle for ensuring safe and effective maintenance of wet wells at sewage treatment plants

## Examples
* New York: single municipal hotline services
* Tokyo: tech to reduce food waste and energy usage
* Reykjavik, Iceland: Better Reykjavik - participatory budgeting portal for citizen online voting
