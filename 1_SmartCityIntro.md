# Smart City - a systems engineering approach | Lecture 1 - Introduction

## Smart City - Broad
> British Standards Institute (BSI) defines smart city as "the effective __integration of physical, digital and human systems__ in the built environment to deliver sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its citizens" (BSI, 2014)

## Smart City - Data-driven
> Cisco defines the term as those cities that adopt "scalable solutions that take advantage of __information and communications technology (ICT)__ to increase efficiencies, reduce costs and enhance quality of life"

## Smart City - Data-driven
> IBM defines a smart city as "one that makes optimal use of all the __interconnected information__ available today to better understand and control its __operations__ and optimize the use of __limited resources__"

## Smart City - Citizen-focused
> According to the Manchester Digital Development agency, "a 'smart city' means __smart citizens__ - where citizens have all the __information__ they need to make __informed choices__ about their lifestyle, work and travel options"

## Smart City - Key technologies

What most smart city definitions have in common is that they consider the use of __smart technologies and data__ as the means to solve cities' sustainability challenges - economic, social and environmental issues.
* Smart technologies can be classified broadly as __information and communications technology__ (ICT) solutions.
* Data is also central to smart cities, especially the use of __big data and open data__.

## Smart City - My own

Smart city is the city equipped with interconnected Internet of Things (IoT) devices and data that helps all the city citizens to effectively use available resources and make their life easier and happier.   

## Smart City - drawbacks

* Privacy concerns: who can access the data gathered? What is done with the data?
* Security and safety concerns: who can access and (mis)use the data?
* Cost of living: who pays for the investments made?
* Cost of energy: how to power all these sensors and connectivity?

## Hong Kong as smart city
### An example - smart lampposts

* Today
  * 50
  * Kwun Tong/Kai Tak Development Area
* Future
  * 400
  * Central/Admiralty, Causeway Bay/Wan Chai, Tsim Sha Tsui and Kwun Tong/Kai Tak Development Area

### Smart Living Initiatives - Combat COVID-19 using I&T
* "StayHomeSafe" home quarantine app
* "LeaveHomeSafe" app for contact tracing
* Use of robots for baggage handling, cleansing, disinfection and monitoring
* "HA Go" app for remote consultation using video conferencing technology
* "iAM Smart" app to promote wider use of digital payments

### Smart City - Hong Kong
* Make use of __innovation and technology(I&T)__ to address urban challenges, enhance the effectiveness of __city management__ and improve __people's quality of living__ as well as Hong Kong's sustainability, efficiency and safety
* Enhance Hong Kong's attractiveness to __global businesses and talent__.
* Inspire continuous city innovation and __sustainable economic development__


## Hong Kong Smart City Blueprint
> Vision - Embrace innovation and technology to build a world-famed Smart Hong Kong characterised by strong economy and high quality of living.

> Mission 

* To make people happier, healthier, smarter and more prosperous, and the city greener, more livable, sustainable, resilient and competitive.

* To enable the business to capitalise on Hong Kong's renowned business-friendly environment to foster innovation, transform the city into a living lab and test bed for development

* To provide better care for the elderly and youth and foster a stronger sense of community. To make the business, people and Government more digitally enabled and technology savvy.

* To consume fewer resources and make Hong Kong more environmental friendly, while maintaining its vibrancy, efficiency and livability.
